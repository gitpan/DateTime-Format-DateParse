NAME
    DateTime::Format::DateParse - Parses Date::Parse compatible formats

SYNOPSIS
        use DateTime::Format::DateParse;

        my $dt = DateTime::Format::DateParse->parse_datetime( $date );
        my $dt = DateTime::Format::DateParse->parse_datetime( $date, $zone );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a compatibility wrapper around Date::Parse.

USAGE
  Import Parameters
    This module accepts no arguments to it's "import" method and exports no
    *symbols*.

  Methods
   Class Methods
    *   parse_datetime($date [, $zone])

        Accepts a Date::Parse compatible $date string and optionally a
        Time::Zone compatible $zone string.

        Returns a DateTime object.

GOTCHAS
    *   If parse_datetime is called on a $date that doesn't know specify a
        timezone and $zone is not set, then the timezone of the returned
        DateTime object will be set to the "local" timezone. This is
        consistent with the behavior of Date::Parse.

    *   If parse_datetime is called without a $zone but the $date string
        *does* specify a timezone/offset or if parse_datetime is called with
        a $zone that DateTime::TimeZone does not understand, the returned
        DateTime object will have it's timezone set to a fixed offset from
        UTC. This means that "DST" information is not available and date
        math will not reflect "DST" transitions. This may be resolved for
        true timezones by using the DateTime::TimeZone::Alias module to
        "alias" the Time::Zone timezone to an Olson DB name. This may be
        done automatically in a future release.
